  <h2>javascript</h2>
  <P><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jS/default.asp" target="_blank"> JavaScript</a> is a programming language commonly
    used in web development. It was originally developed
     by Netscape as a means to add dynamic and interactive
      elements to websites. While JavaScript is influenced
      by Java, the syntax is more similar to C and is based
      on ECMAScript, a scripting language developed by Sun
      Microsystems. JavaScript is a client-side scripting
      language, which means the source code is processed by</a>
      the client's web browser rather than on the web server.
       This means JavaScript functions can run after a webpage
       has loaded without communicating with the server.
  For example, a JavaScript function may check a web form before it is submitted
   to make sure all the required fields have been filled out. The JavaScript code
    can produce an error message before any information is actually
     transmitted to the server.</p>
